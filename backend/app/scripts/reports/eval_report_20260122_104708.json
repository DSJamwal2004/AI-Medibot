It is a serious condition.\n\n- Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive disorder characterized by abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension) in the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is one form of a broader condition known as pulmonary hypertension.\n\n- Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in branches of the portal vein, the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver. Portal hypertension itself does not cause symptoms, but complications from the condition can lead to an enlarged abdomen, abdominal discomfort, confusion, drowsiness and internal bleeding.\n\nIf symptoms are severe or worsening, seek medical care.",
