Pulmonary arterial hypertension is one form of a broader condition known as pulmonary hypertension.\n\n- Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in branches of the portal vein, the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver. Portal hypertension itself does not cause symptoms, but complications from the condition can lead to an enlarged abdomen, abdominal discomfort, confusion, drowsiness and internal bleeding.\n\nIf symptoms are severe or worsening, seek medical care.",

They may also feel weak, or have stomach pains, headache, or loss of appetite.\n\n- The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.\n\n- Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild, cold-like symptoms in adults and older healthy children. It can cause serious problems in young babies, including pneumonia and severe breathing problems.\n\nIf symptoms are severe or worsening, seek medical care.",
